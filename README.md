# storage-api

The storage API is a new a concept that we're working on at Scottylabs for 2017. It's a tool that lets hackers quickly set up an upstream data base for their server hacks. The api should be a tool that lets hackers access a free simple database through rest that can hold information for their client-facing users.

Since many hackers are inexperienced with handling databases, this will let deal with it through a more widely known interface: http-requests. We can also do some really interesting things with a system like this working via oauth.
